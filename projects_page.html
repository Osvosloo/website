            <h3>-Big Data</h3>
            <p>Description: Working with big data and automation in the mining-sector.<br>
                Experience in working to automate the workflow of a company, specialising
                in Machinery Inspection and Quality Control Testing.<br> During these 
                inspections, hundreds (sometimes even thousands) of data points are recorded.<br>
                This data needs to be analysed, processed and reported on.
                I write programs to make this as easy as possible with buttery-smooth workflows
                and reliable automation at heart.   </p>

                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Scripting for Excell</li>
                <li>Handful of powerful Python libraries</li>

            <h3>Game Development</h3>
            <p>Description: I made a small PC game for my friends and I to play. I grew tired of the industry-standard
                for games and wanted to have control over the core gameplay, which isn't something that all game studios offer players.
                So, I decided to use the Unity Game Engine for the project. The core gameplay is a strategy/luck-based card game,
                similar to games like 'Magic: The Gathering' or 'GWENT', the card game from 'The Witcher',
                where players can collect cards by playing the game but must also use some randomly drawn common cards during a match.
                Up to four players can play the game. Even though it's a bit rough around the edges, it was still a fun project.</p>
